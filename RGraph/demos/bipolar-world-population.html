    <p></p>

    This goes in the documents header (or you could place it just above the jQuery ready event code):
    <pre class="code">
&lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.common.core.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.common.dynamic.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.common.tooltips.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.bipolar.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
    
    Put this where you want the chart to show up:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;canvas id="cvs" width="800" height="600"&gt;
    [No canvas support]
&lt;/canvas&gt;
</pre>

    This is the code that generates the chart. Because it's using the jQuery ready event you can put this at the
    bottom of the document:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function ()
